## :star: Key Features

1. **Student Assessment:** Students assess their teammates anonymously on a 7-point scale across four dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The evaluation promotes honest feedback and helps improve team performance.
    - Cooperation: Participation in meetings, communication, assistance, and volunteering.
    - Conceptual Contribution: Research, idea generation, and identification of difficulties.
    - Practical Contribution: Report writing, reviewing others' work, and organizational contributions.
    - Work Ethic: Attitude, respect for teammates, deadlines, and commitments.

2. **Automated Score Sharing and Feedback:** After submissions, scores are aggregated, and anonymous peer feedback is shared with students. Instructors receive detailed reports of individual and team performance.

3. **Instructor Dashboard:** Instructors can manage teams and access detailed peer assessment results by team and student. Data can also be exported as CSV files for further analysis.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Development Methodology

This uses the scrum agile development framework. Development is broken down into four (4) development sprints.

### Story Points

This project uses the modified Fibonacci scale to assign story points:
- 0, 1, 2: Trivial user stories.
- 3, 5: Small user stories.
- 8, 13: Medium-complexity user stories that can be accomplished in a single sprint.
- 20, 40, 100: Large user stories or epics that cannot be accomplished in a single sprint.
